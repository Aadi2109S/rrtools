\usage{
use_travis(pkg = ".", browse = interactive(), docker = TRUE,
  rmd_to_knit = "path_to_rmd", ask = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{defaults to the package in the current working directory}

\item{browse}{open a browser window to enable Travis builds for the package automatically}

\item{docker}{logical, if TRUE (the default) the travis config will build a Docker container according to the instructions in the Dockerfile, and build and install the package in that container. If FALSE, the standard config for R on travis is used.}

\item{ask}{should the function ask with \code{yesno()} if an old .travis.yml should be overwritten with a new one? default: TRUE}
}
\description{
This has two options. One is the same as `devtools::use_travis`, a vanilla travis config that builds, installs and runs the custom package on travis. The other type of configuration directs travis to build the Docker container (according to the instructions in your Dockerfile) and push the successful result to Docker Hub. Using a Dockerfile is recommended because it gives greater isolation of the computational enviroment, and will result in much faster build times on travis.
